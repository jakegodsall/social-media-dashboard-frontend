## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS modules
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) - Build tool

### Significant components

- A corresponding [Figma](https://www.figma.com) design file has been created as practice using the software.
- A global state of theme (dark mode/light mode) is set and passed to all necessary components using the `Context API`.
- Data is stored in a JavaScript object in a realistic structure, and then passed to each component as required (taking the principle of least privilege into account).


### Continued development

- The final step is to save the users default theme using the `Local Storage API` and the `useEffect` hook in React.
